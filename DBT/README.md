Project: Analytics Pipeline for an E-Commerce Platform

Objective: Build a complete data transformation pipeline using DBT for a mock e-commerce platform. You'll transform raw data into analytics-ready datasets to create insightful metrics and reports.

Steps and Scope
1. Set up a Mock Dataset
Data Sources: Create raw CSV files (or use a public dataset) for typical e-commerce operations.

Orders Table: Order ID, user ID, product ID, order date, amount, status, etc.
Users Table: User ID, name, email, signup date, location, etc.
Products Table: Product ID, category, price, stock, etc.
Payments Table: Payment ID, order ID, payment date, method, and amount.
Alternatively, use datasets from sources like:

-Kaggle
-Mockaroo
-BigQuery Public Datasets

2. Set Up Your DBT Environment
- Choose a warehouse:
    - Free options: BigQuery sandbox, PostgreSQL (local or on the cloud)
-Install DBT:
    - Follow the DBT installation guide.

3. Define Raw Models
- Load raw data from CSVs or your warehouse.
- Create raw models in DBT that simply select the raw data from the source.

4. Build Transformation Layers
 - Use the staging models for clean, standardized data:
    - Remove duplicates.
    - Standardize date formats, capitalization, etc.
    - Split nested JSON if applicable.
- Create intermediate models:
    - Join relevant tables (e.g., orders with users).
    - Calculate new fields like total_order_value, average_order_value, or customer_lifetime_value.
- Build final models:
    - Aggregate data for reporting (e.g., daily revenue, top-selling products).

5. Create Metrics
- Use DBT's metrics layer (introduced in DBT 1.0+):
    - Metrics like:
    - Total Revenue
    - Average Order Value
    - Monthly Active Users
    - Churn Rate
    - Conversion Rate

6. Validate with Tests
- Write tests for:
    - Data freshness (DBT freshness checks).
    - Null values and constraints (e.g., unique user IDs, no negative prices).
7. Documentation
- Document your models:
    - Use DBT's YAML files to add descriptions and lineage.
    - Generate DBT docs and explore relationships via the lineage graph.
8. Visualize Results
- Export the final tables to a BI tool like Tableau, Looker Studio, or Power BI.
- Create dashboards to visualize insights like:
    - Revenue trends.
    - Sales by category.
    - User growth over time.
9. Bonus Features
- Add a macro to automate repetitive tasks (e.g., dynamically generating date ranges).
    - Use DBT snapshots to track changes over time (e.g., changes in product prices).
    - Experiment with incremental models for large datasets.
